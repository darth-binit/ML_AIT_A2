This is new project where we have developed new custom Regression Model as `Model A2`. This is a continuation to our first Model A1. The dataset are all the same, 
only that model is now Linear regression based as compared to decision trees in A1.
The application has been deployed into the ml.brain server, to visit the application, kindly log in to this address **https://st124783.ml.brain.cs.ait.ac.th**

`Note`: To view workings of this model, the working.ipynb file is to be seen and not the tensor.ipynb (this is to see if we can train the model using gpu but author has done some feature selection in this file)
